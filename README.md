# Hands-on Bayesian inference workshop: Notes
This is a repository for R markdown notebooks used in the hands-on Bayesian inference workshop (Summer 2024; Category Laboratory, Department of Psychology, Vanderbilt University).

## Goal
This workshop was organized for graduate students who have learned graduate-level introductory statistics and are interested in practicing Bayesian statistics and inference. Participants were assumed to have an understanding of general linear modeling (t-test, ANOVA, linear regression, generalized linear models) and a basic coding skill in popular modern programming languages for numerical computation (e.g., R, Python). The goals of this workshop were

 1. To learn how to use R and Stan to implement a probabilistic model for Bayesian inference
 2. (By achieving 1,) to understand how Bayesian modeling packages built on R/Stan operate.
 3. To understand the good practices of Bayesian modeling: Parameter estimation, model comparison, predictive check, etc.
